= Outline of Automatic Employment Decision Technology Analysis with Focus on Bias Against Those with Disabilities


=== 1. Abstract
* Hypothesis: Lack of accommodation and accessibility features in AI/ML in HCM/TA is causing screen-out harm to candidates with disabilities.

=== 2. Intro
* Some overall stats on employment and why we should care
* What is screen-out in HCM/TA?
* Impacts of these AI technologies on different disabilities

WARNING: 99% of Fortune 500 companies had AI tools somewhere within their hiring plans

=== 3. Context
* How these AI technologies(resume & video screening) work?

=== 4. Methodology of Study
* link:https://github.com/midiker/aedt-analysis/blob/main/aedt_analysis.ipynb[Code implementation]
* Explanation of how features were chosen

=== 5. Results and Discussion

* Answer key questions with pivot tables/charts
* Q1: How do smaller companies compare to the whole sample?
