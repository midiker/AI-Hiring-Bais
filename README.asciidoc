= Outline of Automatic Employment Decision Technology Analysis with Focus on Bias Against Those with Disabilities


=== 1. Abstract
* Hypothesis: Lack of accommodation and accessibility features in AI/ML in HCM/TA is causing screen-out harm to candidates with disabilities.
* Basic summary of what you did (1-2 sentences)
* Basic summary of results (1-2 sentences)

=== 2. Intro
* Some overall stats on employment and why we should care
** In 2021, 16 to 64 years old persons with a disability had over double the rate of unemployment of 10.8%
** In 2020, the percentage of persons with a disability making $75k or more a year was 40.01% less than those without a disability

* In general AI systems are marketed as being objective and helping with bias, but traditional bias testing often ignores those with disabilities and issues around screenout, when companies even atttempt to tackle these issues. Many don't as we'll see below.

* How these AI technologies(resume & video screening) work/ what algorithms do companies?
** Resume Screening: Natural Language Process algorithms are used for keywords and grammar extracting

** AI Video screening: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are used

** Recommendation Systems: Generalized Linear Mixed (GLMix) models which combines learning-to-rank features, tree interaction features, and GBDT model scores.


[WARNING]
====
99% of Fortune 500 companies had AI tools somewhere within their hiring plans

* What is screen-out in HCM/TA?

**  "Screen out because of a disability is unlawful if the individual who is screened out is able to perform the essential functions of the job, with a reasonable accommodation if one is legally required" - ADA

** Examples: Gamification, AI video interview software, Chatbots and other algorithmic decision-making tools

* Impacts of these AI technologies on different disabilities

** Some “gamified” tests maybe benefice for some neurodivergent candidates but not for candidates with other disabilities such as physical disabilities
** AI video interview software negatively impacts both neurodivergent and physical disabilities candidates

|=======

** Q2:
Do companies that don't offer accommodations perform poorly across other categories/features? -WIP

** Q3:
Does a disparity exist between companies mentioning neurodiversity on their website versus physical disabilities? / Does a company addressing neurodiversity make them more likely to offer disability accommodations versus when a company addresses physical disability?

** Q4: If a company reports bias testing is it more likely that they offer accommodations?
